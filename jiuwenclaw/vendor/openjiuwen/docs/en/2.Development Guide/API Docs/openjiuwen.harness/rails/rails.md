# openjiuwen.harness.rails

Built-in guardrails that hook into the `DeepAgent` lifecycle. Rails are registered via `DeepAgent.add_rail()` or through the `rails` parameter in [`create_deep_agent`](../factory.md#function-openjiuwenharnesscreate_deep_agent).

## Overview

| Rail | Description |
|---|---|
| `DeepAgentRail` | Base rail class for `DeepAgent`-specific lifecycle hooks. |
| `ContextEngineeringRail` | Manages context window by compressing or offloading older messages. |
| `FileSystemRail` | Enforces file-system access boundaries (e.g. restrict to workspace). |
| `HeartbeatRail` | Emits periodic heartbeat events during long-running loops. |
| `MemoryRail` | Integrates long-term memory read/write into the agent loop. |
| `ProgressiveToolRail` | Dynamically loads and unloads tools based on relevance to the current task. |
| `SecurityRail` | Applies security policies such as command allowlists and path validation. |
| `SessionRail` | Manages session lifecycle events (create, resume, persist). |
| `SkillEvolutionRail` | Tracks and evolves agent skills based on usage patterns. |
| `SkillUseRail` | Enables the agent to discover and invoke learned skills. |
| `SubagentRail` | Manages sub-agent spawning, delegation, and result collection. |
| `TaskCompletionRail` | Evaluates whether the current task is complete and triggers the stop condition. |
| `TaskMemoryRail` | Persists and retrieves task-specific memory across iterations. |
| `TaskPlanningRail` | Generates and maintains a structured task plan during the loop. |
| `AskUserRail` | Pauses the loop to ask the user a clarifying question (interrupt). |
| `ConfirmInterruptRail` | Requires user confirmation before executing sensitive operations. |

## Rail Lifecycle

Each rail can implement one or more of the following hooks:

- **before_round**: Called before the inner `ReActAgent` starts a round.
- **after_round**: Called after the inner agent completes a round.
- **before_tool_call**: Called before a tool is executed.
- **after_tool_call**: Called after a tool returns.
- **on_init**: Called once when the agent is configured.
- **on_complete**: Called when the task loop finishes.

Rails are executed in registration order. A rail may short-circuit by returning a signal (e.g. force-finish, interrupt) that prevents subsequent rails and the round itself from running.
