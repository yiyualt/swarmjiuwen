"""Worktree rail base class with lifecycle hooks.

Extends DeepAgentRail with 8 hook methods for worktree lifecycle events:
create, exit, file write, commit, and sync phases. WorktreeManager calls
these hooks directly (not via AgentCallbackEvent routing) because worktree
events span across tool calls rather than within the agent task-loop.
